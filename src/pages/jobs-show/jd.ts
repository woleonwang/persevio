### **About Immortal Dragon (不朽真龙)**

Immortal Dragon is an early-stage venture fund and incubator based in Singapore. Founded in 2024, we invest in and build frontier innovations in **AI for health, biotechnology, and Decentralized Science (DeSci)**.
<br/>
Our mission is bold and simple: **Declare War on Death.**
<br/>
We are:
-   **A small, elite team (1–10 people)**    
-   **Working at the cutting edge of longevity, AI, and healthspan innovation**    
-   **Deep-thinking, high-performance, and mission-obsessed**
    
If you want to work directly with founders on frontier problems, this is the place.

----------

### **The Role: CEO Special Assistant (A Founder’s Right Hand, Not an Admin)**

This is **not** a typical administrative job. This is a **Founder’s Apprentice** role—created for someone smart, ambitious, and fast-learning who wants to be involved in:

-   How decisions are made
-   How a venture fund and incubator operate    
-   How new initiatives start
-   How strategy gets executed
-   How a company is actually built
    

You will work directly with the CEO and co-founders across strategy, operations, research, execution, and special projects.

**Administrative tasks do exist**, but only as **necessary foundations** that allow you to:

-   Sit in important meetings
-   Drive strategic work end-to-end
-   Take ownership of mini-projects    
-   Learn how high-level decisions are made
-   Build toward leading your own initiatives in the future
    

We are explicitly designing this role as a **leadership-development pipeline**.

----------

### **Mission of the Role**

Enable the CEO and co-founders to operate at peak strategic bandwidth while **developing into a future operator, investor, or leader** within the organization.

----------

### **What You Will Actually Do (Strategic First, Admin as Enabler)**

1.  #### **Strategic & Operational Enablement (Core Focus)**
    -   Join founder meetings across investment, operations, partnerships, and R&D.
    -   Distill discussions into insights, decisions, and action plans.
    -   Research new areas quickly (AI, biotech, DeSci, markets, ecosystems).
    -   Identify blind spots, bring fresh perspectives, challenge assumptions.
    -   Keep cross-functional projects moving—end-to-end ownership.
    

**Admin support (scheduling, logistics, note-taking) sits under this bucket—not as “chores,” but as your ticket into all high-level rooms.**

----------

2.  #### **Strategic Projects & Business Initiatives**
    Depending on your capability, you may:
    -   Lead specific research or strategic workstreams
    -   Run internal operational improvements
    -   Manage early investment theses
    -   Support dealflow, diligence, or portfolio work
    -   Drive community or ecosystem-building initiatives
    -   Oversee small business experiments or special projects
    

This role can grow into **Chief of Staff**, **Investment Associate**, or **New Venture Lead**—depending on your trajectory.

----------

3.  #### **Founder Infrastructure, Finance, and Legal Coordination**
    You will help the founders keep the engine running smoothly by:
    -   Coordinating with finance teams on planning and paperwork
    -   Handling essential bank, compliance, and operational documentation
    -   Supporting legal review and execution processes
    -   Tracking commitments and deadlines across multiple stakeholders
    

These processes don’t define the role—but they _enable_ you to operate as a trusted extension of the founders.

----------

4.  #### **Office, Operations & Occasional Ground Support**
    -   Manage office administration or renovation projects
    -   Oversee key vendors and infrastructure
    -   Step in for important operational needs when required
    
These tasks are **not the main job**, but part of operating in an early-stage environment where everyone does what is needed to win.

----------

### **Who We’re Looking For (High-Agency, High-IQ Builder)**

1.  #### **Exceptional Intelligence & Learning Speed (Must-Have)**
    You must be able to pick up complex topics quickly—across AI, biotech, operations, finance, and whatever else emerges.

    Evidence may include:
    -   Top performance in quantitative/scientific fields
    -   Demonstrated use of AI tools
    -   Personal or academic projects requiring deep learning
    -   Strong analytical writing or thinking

----------

2.  #### **Extreme Ownership & Reliability**

    We need someone who:
    -   Anticipates needs
    -   Executes fast
    -   Handles ambiguity
    -   Produces high-quality work without reminders
    -   Takes responsibility for outcomes
    

This role requires **responsiveness and occasional cross-timezone coordination**.

----------
3.  #### **Fluent Bilingual Communication (English + Mandarin)**
    
    You must be able to communicate professionally, clearly, and diplomatically across both languages.

    A short video demo in your non-native language is required.

----------

4.  #### **Singapore-Based, Hybrid Work, Global Flexibility**
    -   In Singapore
    -   Hybrid schedule (remote-first, in-office as needed)
    -   Comfortable with occasional business travel
    
----------

5.  #### **Bonus Skills**
    -   Familiarity with Google Suite / Office / Notion
    -   Driver’s license is a plus
    

----------

## **Why This Role Is Life-Changing for the Right Person**

#### ⭐ **1. You work directly with founders on the frontier of longevity, biotech & AI.**

You’ll see how decisions are made, how investments are evaluated, and how strategic initiatives are built.

#### ⭐ **2. You’ll compress years of learning into months.**

This is the equivalent of: **Strategy + Ops + Chief of Staff + VC + Entrepreneur apprenticeship—all in one.** A “3 months = 5 years of growth” environment.

#### ⭐ **3. You’ll gain autonomy early.**

Founders will trust you with real responsibilities, meaningful decisions, and visible work from day one.

#### ⭐ **4. You join a mission with global relevance.**

Working in healthspan, longevity, and AI means your work can contribute to meaningful progress for humanity.

#### ⭐ **5. You build a career trajectory few roles can offer.**
Depending on your strengths, you can graduate into:
-   Chief of Staff
-   Strategy Lead
-   Investment Associate
-   Venture Builder / New Initiative Lead
-   Or even Founder of a future incubated company
    

----------

If you want a role that is challenging, fast-paced, intellectually demanding, and deeply meaningful—and you want to learn directly from founders in a frontier field—this might be your next big step.`;
